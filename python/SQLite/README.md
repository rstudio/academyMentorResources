## SQL to Pandas dataframe
To demonstrate how easy it is to integrate with a database system, you can simply use SQLite lib, drop a SQLite db file into a local directory and run SQL commands to it. Use pandas directly or convert the result to a pandas dataframe. Many data scientists use SQL daily and they want to see how to access a db with Python or R.

The example db is taken from [https://github.com/dtaivpp/car_company_database/tree/master](https://github.com/dtaivpp/car_company_database/tree/master). You find the ER diagram in the repo link above.
There is an equivalent example for RSQLite in the R folder.
