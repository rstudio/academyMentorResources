## Introduction

Welcome to `academyMentorResources`, intended as a home for mentor demos / mentor led instruction for Academy mentors.

Resources are organized by topic, under the general headings of
- `python`
- `tidyverse`
- `pinr` (programming in R)
- `shiny`

Demos should be reproducible by any user; please craft your examples accordingly, along with any useful information (background / code comments / etc) that may give context to another user.
