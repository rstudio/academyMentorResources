## Introduction

Welcome to `academyMentorResources`, intended as a home for mentor demos / mentor led instruction for Academy mentors.

Resources are organized by topic, under the general folders of

- `python`
- `tidyverse`
- `pinr` (programming in R)
- `shiny`

Guidelines for demos:

- built on open data (using the [Academy Data Gallery](https://posit-academy.quarto.pub/data-gallery/) or other sources)
- fully reproducible
- stand-alone / self-explanatory (code includes context, comments, etc)
