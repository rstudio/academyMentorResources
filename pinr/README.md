## Topics

### Functions
- `development-workflow_jmclawson.qmd`
  - Write working code before developing functions. Uses `starwars` with `across()` to write custom functions and explain dotted argument conventions. 
- `repetitive-workflows_jmclawson.qmd`
  - Simplify repetitive processes with functions. Uses `palmerpenguins` and `ggplot2` to apply a common style to figures. 

Other topics to include:
- Control function flow
- Iterating + writing functions (purrr intro)
- Iterate with for loops (purrr revisted, map)
- Function-writing best practices
- Debugging + state management
- Package development


## File naming format
- Currently using: `tutorial-name_dataset_name.qmd`
- Omit dataset if no external dataset is used
- Name is first initial + last name or github username (or something else)
