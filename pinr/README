Topics may include:
- Functions
  - `development-workflow_jmclawson.qmd`: Write working code before developing functions. Uses `starwars` with `across()` to write custom functions and explain dotted argument conventions. 
  - `repetitive-workflows_jmclawson.qmd`: Simplify repetitive processes with functions. Uses `palmerpenguins` and `ggplot2` to apply a common style to figures. 
- Control function flow
- Iterating + writing functions (purrr intro)
- Iterate with for loops (purrr revisted, map)
- Function-writing best practices
- Debugging + state management
- Package development
