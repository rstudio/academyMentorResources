## Start with a specific task

Even when the goal is to simplify some general workflow, it's best to get the code working outside of a function first. For example, if the goal is to find the average of *any* set of columns in *any* data set, it's best to start by finding the average of a *specific* set of columns in a *specific* dataset:

```{r}
starwars |> 
  summarize(
    across(
      .cols = all_of(c("height", "mass")), 
      .fns = mean, 
      na.rm = TRUE
      )
    )
```

Getting the code right will sometimes take trial and error. Here, I initially used `c()` to define the `.cols` vector. Only after getting a warning did I remember to use `all_of()`.

## Generalize it into a function

Once the code works in a way that's expected, it's time to generalize it into a function. Replace each specific item with a general variable:

```{r}
get_averages <- function(data, variables) {
  data |> 
    summarize(
      across(
        .cols = all_of(variables), 
        .fns = mean, 
        na.rm = TRUE
        )
      )
}
```

Check to make sure the function still works as expected:

```{r}
starwars |> 
  get_averages(c("height", "mass"))
```

## Modify as desired

Always, it's best to start from working code. Code from this working function can be adapted for another that instead returns random samples from columns:

```{r}
get_sample <- function(data, variables, .size = 1) {
  data |> 
    summarize(
      across(
        .cols = all_of(variables), 
        .fns = sample, 
        size = .size
      )
    )
}
```

This function uses dotted notation to define the `.size` varable. We do this to avoid naming conflicts: Writing something like `size = size` can make it unclear where a value comes from, but `size = .size` avoids the ambiguity.

As always, check that it works:
```{r}
starwars |> 
  get_sample(c("name", "height", "mass"))

starwars |> 
  get_sample(c("species", "homeworld"), .size = 2)
```
